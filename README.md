# Overview
This program is a series of simple games like a random number guessing game and hangman. It will have more in the future. The reason I wanted to make
this program was because it allowed me to refamilarize myself with the C++ Language and its syntax. It can be an ongoing project that can continue to
grow as I add more and more games to the library.

# Development Environment

The Enviornment I utilize is Visual Studio (NOTE: THIS IS NOT VISUAL STUDIO CODE, THEY ARE DIFFERENT). The language I wrote this in is C++ and I
use various libraries such as iostream, string, and random. These allow me to do things like grab random numbers, use the string class,
and send output or recieve input.
